## Project Name: 
GDB File Metadata Extraction Workflows with Python


## Introduction: 
This project involved creating a comprehensive Python-based solution to extract metadata from ESRI File Geodatabases (GDB), encompassing both vector (feature classes) and raster datasets, and organizing the extracted information into structured Word documents. 
The objective was to automate metadata extraction and streamline documentation for GIS datasets, enhancing data transparency, minimizing manual effort, and ensuring consistency in reporting.



## Responsibilities: 
- Designed and developed Python scripts using arcpy, osgeo.gdal, fiona, and docx to extract and document spatial metadata from GDB files.
- Automated Word report generation with structured tables and sections for feature classes and raster datasets.
- Built modular, reusable code supporting batch processing with integrated logging, error handling, and progress tracking.
- Collaborated with GIS teams to define reporting standards, validate metadata quality, and customize output templates.
- Documented workflows and user guides to support script maintainability, scalability, and production deployment.
