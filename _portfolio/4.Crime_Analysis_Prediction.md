## Project Name: 
Chicago Crime Analysis and Prediction

## Introduction: 
The main objective of project is to anticipate if a neighborhood in the city, at a given duration of the day will be a crime hotspot or not, with an acceptable rate of accuracy. Research aims to exploit background criminal knowledge procured from Chicago Police Department’s CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. The analysis is further extended to incorporate the impact of housing and inhabitation, literacy rate, employment and socioeconomic status on the crime occurrence rate.


## Problem Statement: 
The number of crimes in Chicago increase, more and more people care about their safety, and the government leader want to build a good environment to the citizens. Therefore, it is required to predict the occurrence of a crime at a location at a specific time of a day and to anticipate if a particular neighborhood in the city, at any given duration of the day will be a crime hotspot or not, with an acceptable rate of accuracy. Furthermore, to incorporate the impact of housing and inhabitation, literacy rate, employment and socioeconomic status on the crime occurrence rate.

## Proposed Approach
Chicago, Illinois ranks third in the United States in population (2.7 million), second in the categories of total murders, robberies, aggravated assaults, property crimes, and burglaries, and first in total motor vehicle thefts. In addition to its large population and high crime rates, Chicago maintains a rich data portal containing, among other things, a complete listing of crimes documented by the Chicago Police Department. Have procured criminal records from the Chicago Police Department’s CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. Table 1 depicts the attributes considered by system model and is referred to as the dataset.

 - Geographic transformation variable: Census_COUNTY_FIP

## Analysis and Results:
 Performed Vehicle Crash data analysis and binding 3 datasets into final dataset in the time frame 2015-2019:
 
- Data transformation process is achieved in this project by converting data from one format to another, typically from the format of a source system into the required format of a destination system.
- Data transformation is a component of most data integration and data management tasks, such as data wrangling and data warehousing.
- Joined 3 datasets (Crash Info + Person Info + Vehicle Info) using the linkage variable CRASH REPORT NUMBER, to make final dataset for the Maryland Crash analysis project. These 3 datasets are having data from year 2015 to 2019.
- Involved in data cleanup process for the datasets. Below are the sample steps.
1. **Clipping** the crash points dataset to within the Maryland state <br>
    - arcpy.analysis.Clip("MD_Vehicle_Crash_Data", "MD_Counties", out_feature_class, None)
2. **Data Type conversion:** Converting from string to date object and Numeric formats. <br>
    - arcpy.management.ConvertTimeField("MD_Vehicle_Crash_Data", "ACC_DATE", "yyyyMMddHHmmss", "CRASH_DATE", "DATE", "Not Used")
    - with arcpy.da.UpdateCursor(CrashInfoFC, ["DATE_OF_BIRTH", "DOB"]) as cursor:
3. **Deleting fields** from dataset using Python notebook scripts
    - arcpy.DeleteField_management(finalFC, [field.name]
4. **Joining** datasets: <br>
    - arcpy.management.AddJoin("MD_Vehicle_Crash_Data", "REPORT_NR", "MD_Crashes_Person_Vehicle_Info", "MD_Crashes_Person_Info.REPORT_NO", "KEEP_COMMON", "NO_INDEX_JOIN_FIELDS")
5. Used **Spatial Join/Summarize within** tools to calculate the aggregate crash counts by County.
