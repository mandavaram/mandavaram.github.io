## Project Name: 
Maryland Statewide Vehicle Crash & Fatality Analysis

## Introduction: 
Tasked to analyze Maryland Statewide vehicle crashes and build a spatial dataset using the data sources approved crash
reports. Analysis relating to vehicle crashes (Fatal, Injury & Property Damage), and forecasting on how to avoid further
crashes is provided in addition to Vehicle Crash Report comparison charts.


## Abstract: 
Using vehicle crash data, person information, and vehicle information datasets to analyze crash reports, analyzed the
vehicle crash data on below factors to minimize the fatality accidents:
1. Weather conditions
2. Driving under influence (Alcohol/drug)
3. Underage driving
4. Road conditions
5. Crash count analysis by County
6. Speeding related crashes

## Data sources:
Used data from the following sources: 

 - Maryland Statewide Vehicle Crashes. <a href="https://opendata.maryland.gov/Public-Safety/Maryland-Statewide-Vehicle-Crashes/65du-s3qu">Source URL</a>

 - Maryland Statewide Vehicle Crashes - Person Details. <a href="https://opendata.maryland.gov/Public-Safety/Maryland-Statewide-Vehicle-Crashes-Person-Details-/py4c-dicf">Source URL</a>

 - Maryland Statewide Vehicle Crashes - Vehicle Details. <a href="https://opendata.maryland.gov/Public-Safety/Maryland-Statewide-Vehicle-Crashes-Vehicle-Details/mhft-5t5y">Source URL</a>

 - American Community Survey: <a href="https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT5Y2019.B03002?q=B03002:%20HISPANIC%20OR%20LATINO%20ORIGIN%20BY%20RACE&t=Race%20and%20Ethnicity&g=040XX00US24$0500000&y=2019&d=ACS%205-Year%20Estimates%20Detailed%20Tables&tid=ACSDT5Y2019.B03002">B03002  HISPANIC OR LATINO ORIGIN BY RACE </a>
 - Data linkage variable: CRASH_REPORT_NUMBER
 - Geographic transformation variable: Census_COUNTY_FIP

## Analysis and Results:
 Performed Vehicle Crash analysis over the household income for the below 3 variables in the time frame 2017-2021:
 
- Data transformation process is achieved in this project by converting data from one format to another, typically from the format of a source system into the required format of a destination system.
- Data transformation is a component of most data integration and data management tasks, such as data wrangling and data warehousing.
- Joined 3 datasets (Crash Info + Person Info + Vehicle Info) using the linkage variable CRASH REPORT NUMBER, to make final dataset for the Maryland Crash analysis project. These 3 datasets are having data from year 2015 to 2019.
- Involved in data cleanup process for the datasets. Below are the sample steps.
1. **Clipping** the crash points dataset to within the Maryland state <br>
    - arcpy.analysis.Clip("MD_Vehicle_Crash_Data", "MD_Counties", out_feature_class, None)
2. **Data Type conversion:** Converting from string to date object and Numeric formats. <br>
    - arcpy.management.ConvertTimeField("MD_Vehicle_Crash_Data", "ACC_DATE", "yyyyMMddHHmmss", "CRASH_DATE", "DATE", "Not Used")
    - with arcpy.da.UpdateCursor(CrashInfoFC, ["DATE_OF_BIRTH", "DOB"]) as cursor:
3. **Deleting fields** from dataset using Python notebook scripts
    - arcpy.DeleteField_management(finalFC, [field.name]
4. **Joining** datasets: <br>
    - arcpy.management.AddJoin("MD_Vehicle_Crash_Data", "REPORT_NR", "MD_Crashes_Person_Vehicle_Info", "MD_Crashes_Person_Info.REPORT_NO", "KEEP_COMMON", "NO_INDEX_JOIN_FIELDS")
5. Used **Spatial Join/Summarize within** tools to calculate the aggregate crash counts by County.

                    In the map, several census tracts in the County are home to renters who have high costs of living, and map there are multiple census tracts across the county where renters are housing cost burdened. 
                    There are grey areas corresponding to census tracts that were not considered due to missing or too high coefficients of variation.

          This map shows the median homeowning household with a mortgage in almost all of Frederick County census tracts is not housing cost burdened.

          This observation of the map indicates that housing expenditures in Frederick County are somewhat lower for typical homeowners who don’t have mortgages.
