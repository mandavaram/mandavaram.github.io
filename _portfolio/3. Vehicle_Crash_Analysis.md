## Project Name: 
Maryland Statewide Vehicle Crash & Fatality Analysis

## Introduction: 
Tasked to analyze Maryland Statewide vehicle crashes and build a spatial dataset using the data sources approved crash
reports. Analysis relating to vehicle crashes (Fatal, Injury & Property Damage), and forecasting on how to avoid further
crashes is provided in addition to Vehicle Crash Report comparison charts.


## Abstract: 
Using vehicle crash data, person information, and vehicle information datasets to analyze crash reports, analyzed the
vehicle crash data on below factors to minimize the fatality accidents:
1. Weather conditions
2. Driving under influence (Alcohol/drug)
3. Underage driving
4. Road conditions
5. Crash count analysis by County
6. Speeding related crashes

                    In the map, several census tracts in the County are home to renters who have high costs of living, and map there are multiple census tracts across the county where renters are housing cost burdened. 
                    There are grey areas corresponding to census tracts that were not considered due to missing or too high coefficients of variation.
