## Project Name: 
Chicago Crime Analysis and Prediction

## Introduction: 
The main objective of project is to anticipate if a neighborhood in the city, at a given duration of the day will be a crime hotspot or not, with an acceptable rate of accuracy. Research aims to exploit background criminal knowledge procured from Chicago Police Department’s CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. The analysis is further extended to incorporate the impact of housing and inhabitation, literacy rate, employment and socioeconomic status on the crime occurrence rate.


## Problem Statement: 
The number of crimes in Chicago increase, more and more people care about their safety, and the government leader want to build a good environment to the citizens. Therefore, it is required to predict the occurrence of a crime at a location at a specific time of a day and to anticipate if a particular neighborhood in the city, at any given duration of the day will be a crime hotspot or not, with an acceptable rate of accuracy. Furthermore, to incorporate the impact of housing and inhabitation, literacy rate, employment and socioeconomic status on the crime occurrence rate.

## Proposed Approach
Chicago, Illinois ranks third in the United States in population (2.7 million), second in the categories of total murders, robberies, aggravated assaults, property crimes, and burglaries, and first in total motor vehicle thefts. In addition to its large population and high crime rates, Chicago maintains a rich data portal containing, among other things, a complete listing of crimes documented by the Chicago Police Department. Have procured criminal records from the Chicago Police Department’s CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. Table 1 depicts the attributes considered by system model and is referred to as the dataset.

## Data sources:
Used data from the following sources: 
 - Source of datasets: <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2">Source URL</a>

## Technical details:
**1. Data Preprocessing** <br>
In this part, I was involved in cleaning up the crime dataset obtained from the City of Chicago data portal. In the project, I used the most recent data from 2015 to 2018 from the Chicago crime dataset instead of using the whole dataset, which contains 6 million records back to 2001. <br>
Cleaned up the data as below:
 - Excluded records with vague information
 - Removed extremely rare crime types and locations 
 - Converted categorical features to dummy (indicator) variables for classification
 - Extracted the time information and converted categorical features to dummy variables 
 - Added an extra feature "distance to the closest police station"
 - Integrated socioeconomic status of the neighborhood where the crime happened.

**2.  Data Exploration** <br>
In this part, we visualized the data using different methods. We analyzed the trend of crime occurrence for each year (Figure 1). Then, we plotted crime occurrence rates for the following: crime type, scene of crime, and day-month of crime. This gives us a better understanding of the major crimes that occur. We interpret that theft has the highest percentage and is the crime type with the highest crime rate.

## Environment: 
ArcPro environment and Python scripts
