I'm currently working as an application developer using Microsoft .NET technologies and interested in GIS development like web based Esri geospatial applications. My goal is to learn and improve skill set in GIS technologies and Spatial analysis. I'm very confident that the course: GES 486 - Advanced Applications of Geographic Information Systems, will help and improve my skill set in areas like geospatial ontologies, spatial pattern analysis, advanced raster processing, spatial interpolation, and geo-statistics, database design and systems, dynamic GIS modeling, and computational geometry and mathematical techniques used in GIS.

Interest in analyzing and developing projects in below areas:
